    "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nFossil fuels have been our main source of energy for quite a lot of time now, but with the increase in global warming, and the depletion of fossil fuels, many energy giants are shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. But, there is still a lot of time since we can rely totally on the renewable sources of energy.\n\n\nIn the following analysis, we’ll look at the top producers of the fossil fuels and also look at the countries which have the highest reserves of each of the fossil fuel.\n\n\nIt is expected that the country that has more reserves will produce more of that fossil fuel to generate maximum profit. We’ll look into this and try to analyse the factors that may affect this statement."

The exception of Venezuela can be explained due to the fact that Venezuela has heavy oil which is tough to produce due to high viscosity and density. Also the political situation of Venezuela is also not favorable which makes it tougher for the foreign countries to work in Venezuela.\nWhereas, Arabic countries like UAE, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait has light, sweet oil which is very easy to extract, hence eventho they have lesser reserves than Venezuela, they are producing almost the same amount of crude oil as Venezuela."

The countries which don’t usually don’t have the resources to do so. Natural gas is one of the major sources of energy for many countries like USA, it is mainly used for generation of electricity and heating.\nWe also have to take into account the consumption and export of the natural resource into account."

But, we just cant take into account this one factor. There are many other factors that are needed to be taken into account like the import and export , consumption of the resource and many countries are bound by contracts (OPEC) which limits them to how much resource they can produce, this is done to maintain the prices of the comodity in the international market."
